# 👋 Hi, I'm Shifra  
🧪💻 Verification & Software Engineering Student

I like working on **complex systems** and understanding how things behave end-to-end 🔍  
From ⚙️ **hardware verification** to 🌐 **full-stack software**,  
I enjoy debugging, finding edge cases, and building things that actually work.
